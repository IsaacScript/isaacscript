- use stack overflow to remove isaac-typescript-definitions from deps

- Lint:
  - add:     "no-unused-expressions": "warn",
  - lint failure: https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/897
  - prefer implicit loops for arrays, maps, etc. - not implicit, but "default iterator"?
  - double period for end of JSDoc comment lint
  - lint rule: arrays, maps, and sets that start with Capital letter must be read-only




lint error, missing warning for "verbose" missing:

/**
 * Helper function to warp to a custom stage/level.

 * Custom stages/levels must first be defined in the "tsconfig.json" file. See the documentation for

 *
 * @param name The name of the custom stage, corresponding to what is in the "tsconfig.json" file.
 * @param firstFloor Whether to go to the first floor or the second floor. For example, if you have
 *                   a custom stage emulating Caves, then the first floor would be Caves 1, and the

lint failure, complete sentences:

 * Custom grid entities are built on top of real grid entities. You can use any existing grid entity
 * type as a base. For example, if you want to create a custom rock that would be breakable like a
 * normal rock, then you should specify
 *
 * This is an IsaacScript feature because the vanilla game does not support any custom grid
 * entities.

(no trailing period in the middle)


lint failure:

 * These are helper functions relating to creating custom stages with the built-in standard library.
 * For more information about custom stages, see the [main
 * documentation page](https://isaacscript.github.io/main/custom-stages).


lint TODO:
"Implicit iteration is disallowed" marks error over whole function instead of just the set


lint:

 * @returns If a match was found, returns a tuple of the map key and value. If a match was not
 * found, returns undefined.
(should indent)

lint: remove all whitespace in comment (tabs)


lint error if arg is removed:

/**
 * Helper function to get a room position that is not overlapping with a grid entity, a heaven door,
 * or a player. The `Room.FindFreePickupSpawnPosition` method will return locations that overlap
 * with heaven doors and partially overlap with players, if the thing being spawned is bigger than a
 * tile (like a Blood Donation Machine). Use this function instead if you want to account for those
 * specific situations.
 *
 * @param startingPosition The position to start searching from. If this position is not overlapping
 *                         with anything, then it will be returned.
 * @param avoidActiveEntities Optional. Default is false.
 * @param minimumDistance Optional. If specified, will ensure that the randomly generated position

lint:
//test
ctrl+s --> // est
(maybe fix is to just disable other eslint rule)

lint: add no null (only for non isaacscript projects)

lint: no default export

lint: no empty trailing line comment or leading line comment

- use NX workspace variables in all project.json
  - waiting on how to use variables inside of commands from slack

- wait for wof to make https://github.com/wofsauge/Isaac-XML-Validator/ into a CLI program
