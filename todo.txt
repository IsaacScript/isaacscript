- preferTypeOnlyAutoImports does not work

- fix `prefer-readonly-parameter-types` for Array<Foo>

- investigate array vs set performance (also search for "O(1)" afterward)

- change to knip.config.jsonc (potentially, once Knip v4 releases)
- change to cspell.config.jsonc (if knip is changed)

- wait for eslint-plugin-n to fix rule:
  - https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/issues/134
  - if this takes too long, we can make a new ESLint rule to automatically convert 'import *.js";' to '.ts'
  - the idea here is to have IsaacScript mods use ".ts" file extensions instead of ".js"
    - blocked on: https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua/issues/1514
  - for Node.js apps, we don't want to force the use of a bundler such as ESBuild, so they will remain having ".js" file extensions

- wait for typedoc-plugin-markdown to release next version: https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown/discussions/372

- import eslint-plugin-plugin
  - blocked on: https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin/issues/375

- update eslint to new config
  - wait until ESLint 9 is released so that environment flag is not necessary
  - wait until @typescript-eslint/plugin is using flat config and has good docs
  - ESLint does not support "eslint.config.mjs" file format, so it requires either:
    1. changing package.json type
    2. specifying config file location when running, e.g. "--config eslint.config.mjs"

- use stack overflow to remove isaac-typescript-definitions from deps
  - difficult, do it when I have the courage
  - make sure that isaacscript-common still works through link in dev
