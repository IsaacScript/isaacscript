- // TODO: Re-enable.

- redo isaacscript-lint / config in separate repo?
  - release new version with flat config
  - GET RID OF ALL: "./**/.*.mjs",

- experiment with adding "scripts/*.ts" in the allowDefaultProject whitelist

- utils.ts - fix TODO comment

- check every include file in tsconfig.json
  - TRY COMMON INCLUDE PATTERN WITH ${configDir}

- rewrite create docs script to work with latest typedoc-plugin-markdown

- release tsconfig in dev after this and everything else is sorted out

- use `sort-keys` eslint plugin to sort object alphabetically in base-typescript-eslint
  https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-keys

- package.mod.json: dynamically fetch TypeScript version from TSTL GitHub repo

- try removing ESLint parserOptions, since they might not be needed with flat config

- new TSESLint changes:
  - https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v8
  - change project to projectServices
  - remove tsconfig.eslint.json

- remove eslint-plugin-deprecation when available in tseslint

- re-enable knip in lint.ts
- re-enable check-ts in lint.ts
- see top comment of "update.ts" (and uncomment "no-useless-assignment")

- import eslint-plugin-plugin

- change to knip.config.jsonc (potentially, once Knip v4 releases)
- change to cspell.config.jsonc (if knip is changed)

- use stack overflow to remove isaac-typescript-definitions from deps
  - difficult, do it when I have the courage
  - make sure that isaacscript-common still works through link in dev

- test rule import-x/no-default-export once this issue is closed and released:
  https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/issues/121
  (currently the rule is not working with the flat config, but I suspect that the latest release
  might fix this)
  this issue is also relevant:
  https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/issues/29

  - fix returning `Promise<string[]>`
  - fix `prefer-readonly-parameter-types` for Array<Foo>
