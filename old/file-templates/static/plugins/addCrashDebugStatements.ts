/**
 * When you write code that causes the game to crash, it can be difficult to find the exact line of
 * code that is causing the crash.
 *
 * In these situations, you can enable this plugin, which will add a log statement in between every
 * line of Lua code with a randomly-generated UUID. That way, you can cause the crash, and then look
 * at the bottom of the "log.txt" for the final UUID that shows up.
 *
 * Next, you can Ctrl + f in the "main.lua" file for the matching UUID, which will bring you to the
 * exact point in the code where the crash happened.
