   * repeat the last stage on the progress bar of the transition screen and have it be less jarring.
   *
   * Calling this method before the current stage transition has called `Level.SetNextStage` will
   * override the transition itself. This means that instead of merely displaying Isaac's head not
   * moving, it will actually change whether the next stage will be a repeat of the current one, or
   * the actual next stage. Ideally, you should use this function in the
   * `ModCallback.PRE_LEVEL_SELECT`callback.

   *                  the next floor or not.
