title: Using IsaacScript in TypeScript
---

The `isaacscript` CLI tool also supports bootstrapping "normal" TypeScript projects (for i.e. a browser or Node.js) like this:

```sh
npx isaacscript@latest init-ts foo
```

If you have an existing project that was bootstrapped with the tool, you can also check to see if your template files are up to date with:

```sh
npx isaacscript check-ts
```
