# eslint-plugin-isaacscript

<img src="https://isaacscript.github.io/img/items/magic-mushroom.png">

`eslint-plugin-isaacscript` is a collection of miscellaneous [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules that can help make your JavaScript/TypeScript code more safe or more strict.

This plugin is named after (and used in) the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) framework. But you don't have to know anything about IsaacScript to use it - you can use these rules with any JavaScript/TypeScript project.

Alternatively, if you want to get off the ground and running with ESLint + TypeScript in a new project, then you should check out the [`isaacscript-lint`](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/tree/main/packages/isaacscript-lint) meta-package.

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

<br>

## Install / Usage

- `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-isaacscript`
- Add `"plugin:isaacscript/recommended"` to the `extends` section of your `.eslintrc.cjs` file. (This will automatically add the plugin and add all of the recommended rules.)
  - Alternatively, if you want to only enable some specific rules, then add `"isaacscript"` to the `plugins` section of your `.eslintrc.cjs` file, and then add the specific rules that you want in the `rules` section.

<br>

## Configs

- `recommended` - Enables just the recommended rules. (Some rules are not recommended since they are intended for very specific environments.)

<br>

## Rules

Each rule has emojis denoting:

- :white_check_mark: - if it belongs to the `recommended` configuration
- :wrench: - if some problems reported by the rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` [command line option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems)
- :thought_balloon: - if it requires type information

<!-- Do not manually modify the RULES_TABLE section. Instead, run: npm run generate -->

## Automatic Fixing

You probably already use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is helpful to automatically format files. You probably even have your IDE set up to run Prettier every time your save a file. This kind of thing saves you a tremendous amount of time - you can type out a bunch of code completely unformatted, and then press `Ctrl + s` at the end to automatically fix everything. (Alternatively, you could press `Ctrl + shift + f` to format the file without saving it, but it's simpler to just use one hotkey for everything.)

In a similar way to Prettier, this ESLint plugin contains several rules that are designed to automatically apply whenever you save the file (like the [`format-jsdoc-comments`](docs/rules/format-jsdoc-comments.md) rule). These rules are "fixers", which are applied when ESLint is executed with the "--fix" flag. So, in the same way that you configure Prettier to run on save, you should also configure `eslint --fix` to run on save.

For example, if you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and you have the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions installed, you can add the following to your repository's `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```jsonc
{
  // Automatically run the formatter when certain files are saved.
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
    },
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.tabSize": 2
  },
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
    },
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.tabSize": 2
  }
}
```

## Comment Formatting

## Contributing

Thanks for helping out with this open-source project!

If you are adding a new rule, start by using the `create-rule` script to automate a few things:

```sh
npm run create-rule foo "This is a description of the foo rule."
git status # Show what the script did.
```
