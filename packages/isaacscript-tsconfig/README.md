# isaacscript-tsconfig

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/isaacscript-tsconfig.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isaacscript-tsconfig)

These are shared TypeScript configuration files that are intended to be used in either [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) projects or [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) mods.

IsaacScript mods are automatically configured to use these configs.

Note that if you use these configs with `pnpm`, you must also install `@tsconfig/strictest`, since pnpm does not properly handle transitive dependencies.
