/**
 * The standard library has the feature to deploy a new room on-the-fly with the `deployJSONRoom`
 * helper function. It requires a `JSONRoomsFile` as an argument, which is simply an XML file
 * converted to JSON. (You can create XML room files using the Basement Renovator program.)
 *
 * You can convert your XML files using the following command:
 *
 * ```sh
 * npx convert-xml-to-json foo.xml foo.json
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the custom stages feature of the standard library uses real XML/STB files, not JSON
 * rooms, so you would only need to do this if you are using the `deployJSONRoom` command
 * specifically.
