 * Use this function to enable the custom callbacks and other optional features provided by
 * `isaacscript-common`.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const modVanilla = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1);
 * const mod = upgradeMod(modVanilla);
 *
 * // Subscribe to vanilla callbacks.
 * mod.AddCallback(ModCallback.POST_UPDATE, postUpdate);
 *
 * // Subscribe to custom callbacks.
 * mod.AddCallbackCustom(ModCallbackCustom.POST_ITEM_PICKUP, postItemPickup);
 * ```
 *
 * @param modVanilla The mod object returned by the `RegisterMod` function.
 * @param features Optional. An array containing the optional standard library features that you
 *                 want to enable, if any. Default is an empty array.
 * @param debug Optional. Whether to log additional output when a callback is fired. Default is
 *              false.
 * @param timeThreshold Optional. If provided, will only log callbacks that take longer than the
 *                      specified number of seconds (if the "--luadebug" launch flag is turned on)
 *                      or milliseconds (if the "--luadebug" launch flag is turned off).
 * @returns The upgraded mod object.
