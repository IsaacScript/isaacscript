   * 1. When slot machine entities (e.g. `SlotVariant.SLOT_MACHINE` and
   *    `SlotVariant.BLOOD_DONATION_MACHINE`) are destroyed with an explosion. When this happens,
   *    they typically stay in the room and can be pushed around. This state is detected via a
   *    change in the `GridCollisionClass`.
   * 2. When slot machine entities pay out with a collectible item. When this happens, they
   *    immediately despawn without playing any special animation.
   * 3. When beggar entities (e.g. `SlotVariant.BEGGAR` and `SlotVariant.SHELL_GAME`) are destroyed
   *    with an explosion. When this happens, they immediately despawn without playing any special
   *    animation.
   * 4. When beggar entities pay out with a collectible item. When this happens, they despawn after
   *    playing the "Teleport" animation. (This is not technically a "destruction" event, but the
   *    callback will fire for this to remain consistent with the other types of slot entities.)
   *
   * Depending on the specific types of slot removal that you need to detect, you can filter using:

   * 2. The passed callback argument of `SlotDestructionType` to differentiate between bombed slots

   * `SlotDestructionType` will be equal to `SlotDestructionType.NORMAL` instead of

   * When registering the callback with the `ModUpgraded.AddCallbackCustom` method:
   * - You can provide an optional third argument that will make the callback only fire if it
   *   matches the `TearVariant` provided.
   * - You can provide an optional fourth argument that will make the callback only fire if it
   *   matches the sub-type provided.
