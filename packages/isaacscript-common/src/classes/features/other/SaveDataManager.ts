  /**
   * This is the entry point to the save data manager, a system which provides two major features:
   *
   * 1. automatic resetting of variables on a new run, on a new level, or on a new room (as desired)
   * 2. automatic saving and loading of all tracked data to the "save#.dat" file
   *
   * You feed this function with an object containing your variables, and then it will automatically
   * manage them for you. (See below for an example.)
   *
   * In order to use this function, you must upgrade your mod with `ISCFeature.SAVE_DATA_MANAGER`.
   * (Upgrade your mod before registering any of your own callbacks so that the save data manager
   * will run before any of your code does.)
   *
   * The save data manager is meant to be called once for each feature of your mod. In other words,
   * you should not put all of the data for your mod on the same object. Instead, scope your
   * variables locally to a single file that contains a mod feature, and then call this function to
   * register them. For example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * // In file: feature1.ts
   * import { saveDataManager } from "isaacscript-common";
   *
   * // Declare local variables for this file or feature.
   * const v = {
   *   // These variables are never reset; manage them yourself at will.
   *   persistent: {
   *     foo1: 0,
   *   },
   *
   *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every run.
   *   run: {
   *     foo2: 0,
   *   },
   *
   *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every level.
   *   level: {
   *     foo3: 0,
   *   },
   *
   *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every room.
   *   room: {
   *     foo4: 0,
   *   },
   * };
   * // Every child object is optional; only create the ones that you need.
   *
   * // Register the variables with the save data manager. (We need to provide a string key that
   * // matches the name of this file.)
   * function feature1Init() {
   *   saveDataManager("feature1", v);
   * }
   *
   * // Elsewhere in the file, use your variables.
   * function feature1Function() {
   *   if (v.run.foo1 > 0) {
   *     // Insert code here.
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * - Save data is loaded from disk in the `POST_PLAYER_INIT` callback (i.e. the first callback
   *   that can possibly run).
   * - Save data is recorded to disk in the `PRE_GAME_EXIT` callback.
   *
   * You can use many different variable types on your variable object, but not everything is
   * supported. For the specific things that are supported, see the documentation for the `deepCopy`
   * helper function.
   *
   * If you want the save data manager to load data before the `POST_PLAYER_INIT` callback (i.e. in
   * the main menu), then you should explicitly call the `saveDataManagerLoad` function. (The save
   * data manager cannot do this on its own because it cannot know when your mod features are
   * finished initializing.)
   *
   * Some features may have variables that need to be automatically reset per run/level, but not
   * saved to disk on game exit. (For example, if they contain functions or other non-serializable
   * data.) For these cases, set the second argument to `false`.
   *
   * Note that when the player uses Glowing Hour Glass, the save data manager will automatically
   * restore any variables on a "run" or "level" object with a backup that was created when the room
   * was entered. Thus, you should not have to explicitly program support for Glowing Hour Glass
   * into your mod features that use the save data manager. If this is undesired for your specific
   * use-case, then add a key of `__ignoreGlowingHourGlass: true` to your "run" or "level" object.
   *
   * @param key The name of the file or feature that is submitting data to be managed by the save
   *            data manager. The save data manager will throw an error if the key is already
   *            registered.
   * @param v An object that corresponds to the `SaveData` interface. The object is conventionally
   *          called "v" for brevity. ("v" is short for "local variables").
   * @param conditionalFunc Optional. A function to run to check if this save data should be written
   *                        to disk. Default is `() => true`, meaning that this save data will
   *                        always be written to disk. Use a conditional function for the situations
   *                        when the local variables are for a feature that the end-user can
   *                        disable. (If the feature is disabled, then there would be no point in
   *                        writing any of the variables to the "save#.dat" file.) You can also
   *                        specify `false` to this argument in order to completely disable saving
   *                        data. (Specifying `false` will allow you to use non-serializable objects
   *                        in your save data, such as `EntityPtr`.
