  /**
   * Helper function to register a custom pickup with the IsaacScript standard library. Use this
   * feature for custom pickups that are intended to be picked up by the player, like bombs and
   * keys.
   *
   * When IsaacScript detects that a player should be collecting the custom pickup, then the pickup
   * will be immediately removed, and an effect showing the pickup's respective `Collect` animation
   * will be spawned. (This emulates how a normal vanilla pickup would work.) After that, the
   * provided `collectFunc` will be fired. In this function, you will probably want to play a sound
   * corresponding to what kind of pickup it is (e.g. `SoundEffect.KEY_PICKUP_GAUNTLET`), as well as
   * do things like adding something to the player's inventory.
   *
   * Note that when you specify your custom pickup in the "entities2.xml" file, it should have a
   * type of "5" and be associated with an anm2 file that has a "Collect" animation.
   *
   * In order to use this function, you must upgrade your mod with `ISCFeature.CUSTOM_PICKUPS`.
   *
   * @param pickupVariantCustom The variant for the corresponding custom pickup.
   * @param subType The sub-type for the corresponding custom pickup.
   * @param collectFunc The function to run when the player collects this pickup.
   * @param collisionFunc Optional. The function to run when a player collides with the pickup.
   *                      Default is a function that always returns true, meaning that the player
   *                      will always immediately collect the pickup when they collide with it.
   *                      Specify this function if your pickup should only be able to be collected
   *                      under certain conditions.
