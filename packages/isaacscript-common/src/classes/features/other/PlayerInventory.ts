  /**
   * Helper function to get all of the collectibles that the player has gotten so far on this run,
   * in order.
   *
   * In the case of inventory initialization or the case where the player rerolls their build in the
   * middle of the run (e.g. with D4), the order of the inventory will not correspond to the order
   * that the items were actually given to the player. In this case, the inventory will be in the
   * order of the lowest `CollectibleType` to the highest.
   *
   * Under the hood, the inventory tracking works by tracking the number of collectibles that a
   * player has on every frame. Thus, in a situation where a collectible was both added and removed
   * to the player on the same frame, the amount of total collectibles would stay the same, and the
   * inventory would not be updated. In vanilla, this situation would never happen, but another mod
   * might do this for some reason. (With that said, the next time that a collectible is normally
   * added or removed, it would trigger a re-scan, and the previous changes would be picked up.)
   *
   * In order to use this function, you must upgrade your mod with `ISCFeature.PLAYER_INVENTORY`.
   *
   * @param player The player to get the inventory for.
   * @param includeActiveCollectibles Optional. If true, will include all active collectibles.
   *                                Default is true.
