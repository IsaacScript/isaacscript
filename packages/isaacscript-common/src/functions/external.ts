/**
 * Helper function to let the Rebirth Item Tracker know that it should remove a collectible from its
 * list.
 *
 * The "item tracker" in this function does not refer to the in-game item tracker, but rather to the
 * external Python program.
 *
 * This function is variadic, meaning that you can pass as many collectible types as you want to
 * remove.
 *
 * Note that calling this function is not normally necessary when removing collectibles from
 * players. For example, when you remove a collectible with the `EntityPlayer.RemoveCollectible`
 * method, a message is sent to the log file by the game and the item tracker will automatically
 * remove it. However, in some cases, manually removing collectibles can be useful:
 *
 * - We may be giving the player a "fake" collectible (e.g. 1-Up for the purposes of an extra life)
 *   and do not want the fake collectible to show up on the tracker.
 * - We may be removing a starting active item. Since active items are never removed from the
 *   tracker, we want to tell the item tracker that the player never had a particular active item to
 *   begin with.
