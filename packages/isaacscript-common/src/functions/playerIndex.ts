/**
 * Mods often have to track variables relating to the player. In naive mods, information will only
 * be stored about the first player. However, in order to be robust, mods must handle up to 4
 * players playing at the same time. This means that information must be stored on a map data
 * structure. Finding a good index for these types of map data structures is difficult:
 *
 * - We cannot use the index from `Isaac.GetPlayer(i)` since this fails in the case where there are
 *   two players and the first player leaves the run.
 * - We cannot use `EntityPlayer.ControllerIndex` as an index because it fails in the case of Jacob
 *   & Esau or Tainted Forgotten. It also fails in the case of a player changing their controls
 *   mid-run.
 * - We cannot use `EntityPlayer.GetData().index` because it does not persist across saving and
 *   continuing.
 * - We cannot use `GetPtrHash()` as an index because it does not persist across exiting and
 *   relaunching the game.
 * - We cannot use `EntityPlayer.InitSeed` because it is not consistent with additional players
 *   beyond the first.
 *
 * Instead, we use the `EntityPlayer.GetCollectibleRNG` method with an arbitrary value of Sad Onion
 * (1). This works even if the player does not have any Sad Onions.
 *
 * Note that by default, this returns the same index for both The Forgotten and The Soul. (Even
 * though they are technically different characters, they share the same inventory and `InitSeed`.)
 * If this is not desired, pass true for the `differentiateForgottenAndSoul` argument, and the RNG
 * of Spoon Bender (3) will be used for The Soul.
 *
 * Also note that this index does not work in the `POST_PLAYER_INIT` function for players 2 through
 * 4. With that said, in almost all cases, you should be lazy-initializing your data structures in
 * other callbacks, so this should not be an issue.
