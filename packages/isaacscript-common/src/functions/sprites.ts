 * are passed, it will clear every layer.
 *
 * Since there is no official API method to "clear" a sprite, we can work around it by setting the
 * spritesheet to a non-existent or completely transparent file. If the path to the spritesheet does
 * not exist, then this function might cause spurious errors to appear in the "log.txt file". To
 * silence these errors, create a transparent 1 pixel PNG file in your mod's resources folder at the
 * path corresponding to the "EMPTY_PNG_PATH" constant.
