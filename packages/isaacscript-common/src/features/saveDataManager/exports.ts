/**
 * This is the entry point to the save data manager, a system which provides two major features:
 *
 * 1. automatic resetting of variables on a new run, on a new level, or on a new room (as desired)
 * 2. automatic saving and loading of all tracked data to the "save#.dat" file
 *
 * You feed this function with an object containing your variables, and then it will automatically
 * manage them for you. (See below for an example.)
 *
 * The save data manager is meant to be called once for each feature of your mod. In other words,
 * you should not put all of the data for your mod on the same object. Instead, scope your variables
 * locally to a single file that contains a mod feature, and then call this function to register
 * them. For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // in file: feature1.ts
 * import { saveDataManager } from "isaacscript-common";
 *
 * // Declare local variables for this file or feature.
 * const v = {
 *   // These variables are never reset; manage them yourself at will.
 *   persistent: {
 *     foo1: 0,
 *   },
 *
 *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every run.
 *   run: {
 *     foo2: 0,
 *   },
 *
 *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every level.
 *   level: {
 *     foo3: 0,
 *   },
 *
 *   // These variables are reset at the beginning of every room.
 *   room: {
 *     foo4: 0,
 *   },
 * };
 * // Every child object is optional; only create the ones that you need.
 *
 * // Register the variables with the save data manager. (We need to provide a string key that
 * // matches the name of this file.)
 * function feature1Init() {
 *   saveDataManager("feature1", v);
 * }
 *
 * // Elsewhere in the file, use your variables.
 * function feature1Function() {
 *   if (v.run.foo1 > 0) {
 *     // Insert code here.
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * - Save data is loaded from disk in the `POST_PLAYER_INIT` callback (i.e. the first callback that
 *   can possibly run).
 * - Save data is recorded to disk in the `PRE_GAME_EXIT` callback.
 *
 * You can put lots of data types on your variable objects, but not everything is supported. For the
 * specific things that are supported, see the documentation for the `deepCopy` helper function.
 *
 * Note that before using the save data manager, you must call the `upgradeMod` function. (Upgrade
 * your mod before registering any of your own callbacks so that the save data manager will run
 * before any of your code does.)
 *
 * If you want the save data manager to load data before the `POST_PLAYER_INIT` callback (i.e. in
 * the main menu), then you should explicitly call the `saveDataManagerLoad` function. (The save
 * data manager cannot do this on its own because it cannot know when your mod features are finished
 * initializing.)
 *
 * Finally, some features may have variables that need to be automatically reset per run/level, but
 * not saved to disk on game exit. (For example, if they contain functions or other non-serializable
 * data.) For these cases, set the second argument to `() => false`.
 *
 * @param key The name of the file or feature that is submitting data to be managed by the save data
 *            manager. The save data manager will throw an error if the key is already registered.
 * @param v An object that corresponds to the `SaveData` interface. The object is conventionally
 *          called "v" for brevity. ("v" is short for "local variables").
 * @param conditionalFunc Optional. A function to run to check if this save data should be written
 *                        to disk. Default is `() => true`, meaning that this save data will always
 *                        be written to disk. Use a conditional function for the situations when the
 *                        local variables are for a feature that the end-user can disable. (If the
 *                        feature is disabled, then there would be no point in writing any of the
 *                        variables to the "save#.dat" file.) You can also specify `false` to this
 *                        argument in order to completely disable saving data. (Specifying `false`
 *                        will allow you to use non-serializable objects in your save data, such as
 *                        `EntityPtr`.
