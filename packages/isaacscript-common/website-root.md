# `isaacscript-common`

In addition to having access to all of the vanilla classes and enums, IsaacScript mods also can access optional helper functions & features. These are bundled as part of the `isaacscript-common` package. Think of this as an extended part of the Isaac API; they can perform common tasks in a safe way that abstracts away the complexity from you.

You can explore what `isaacscript-common` offers via the left navigation bar.

If you want to use `isaacscript-common` as a Lua library for your Lua code, see the [using IsaacScript in Lua](../main/isaacscript-in-lua.md) page.
