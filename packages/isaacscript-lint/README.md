# isaacscript-lint

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/isaacscript-lint.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isaacscript-lint)

`isaacscript-lint` is a helper package to install all of the dependencies necessary for ESLint to work with a typical TypeScript project or a typical IsaacScript mod.

<br>

## For Use in a TypeScript / TypeScriptToLua Project

`isaacscript-lint` is a great starting point for any TypeScript project. It's a pain in the ass to get ESLint working with TypeScript and to get everything working properly. Don't clutter your `package.json` file with 15+ different ESlint-related dependencies; just use `isaacscript-lint`.

See the [installation instructions](#installation-instructions-for-typescript-projects) below.

<br>

## For Use in an Isaacscript Mod

Use the `isaacscript init` tool to automatically set up a new mod that has `isaacscript-lint` as a dependency and a starting `eslintrc.js` config file.

## Why Code Formatting is Important

In the 90's, the most popular scripting language in the world was [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), invented by [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall). One of Larry's slogans was that "There Is Always More Than One Way To Do It", abbreviated as the TIAMTOWTDI principle. In Perl, there were many different ways to do even the most basic thing, like adding an element to an array. This resulted in a Perl ecosystem where programs often looked nothing like each other, where everyone had different coding styles, and where everything was hard to read and comprehend. <!-- cspell:ignore TIAMTOWTDI -->

One of the key insights of [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), the creator of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, was that [code is read much more often than it is written](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Python was designed to be concise, clean, and readable. It had standard ways of doing things and recommended that everyone follow the [PEP-8 coding standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). And so, in the 90s, there was a massive movement away from Perl and towards Python. Now, Python is the [most popular programming language in the world](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html). <!-- cspell:ignore Rossum -->

[Go](https://golang.org/), the programming language designed at Google in 2009, took this concept a step further. They included a code formatter inside of the language itself, called `gofmt` (which is short for "Go formatter"). When you are coding a Go program, it will automatically format all of the code as soon as you save the file. This can be surprising and disturbing for newcomers: "Why does `gofmt` make my code ugly?!" <!-- cspell:ignore gofmt -->

However, once people get used to the formatter, they realize that it saves them a _tremendous amount of time_. By ignoring all formatting and typing out code "raw", and then summoning the formatter to instantly fix everything, you can quite literally code twice as fast. Rob Pike, one of the creators of Go, famously said that "gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite". ([This YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAAkCSZUG1c?start=523&end=568) of Rob is a much-watch!)

`gofmt` is nice because it saves people from mundane code formatting. But there is also a benefit that is entirely separate and not readily apparent. When looking at other people's Go code on StackOverflow or GitHub, you realize that it looks exactly like your code. It's easy to read and comprehend. And you can copy-paste code snippets from other programs into your own applications without having to change anything! For programmers, this is not the norm, and it feels great - it's the hidden superpower of Go.

When Rob says that everyone loves `gofmt`, he isn't lying. Programmers across the world have taken this concept and ran with it. People now use [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) in [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). <!-- cspell:ignore rustfmt -->

The root of the problem here is that when people try out a new programming language, they often use the same formatting and conventions that they used in their previous language. This fractures the ecosystem and makes everyone's code inconsistent and hard to read. The lesson of Go is that whenever you code in a new language, you should use the standard style that everyone else uses for that language. In this way, every language can have the superpower that Go has.

## TypeScript Code Formatting - ESLint & Prettier

In JavaScript and TypeScript land, there isn't a unifying standard like there is in Go, but we can get close.

Historically, the the most popular style guide is the world is the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). ([Google's Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) and [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) are also notable, but don't seem quite as popular.) Thus, we chose Airbnb as a base for new JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

ESLint is the industry standard tool for linting in JavaScript and TypeScript. Airbnb helpfully provides an ESLint configuration with most of their style recommendations. ESLint can function in a way similar to `gofmt` by configuring your text editor to do `eslint --fix` on save. However, this has a lot of limitations. It can't automatically fix everything and leaves a lot up to the end user to fix.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) was released in 2017 and it has quickly become very widespread. (It could _probably_ also be considered to be industry standard in 2022.) Prettier works by completely rebuilding your code from scratch using the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), which allows it to make much better transformations than pure ESLint can.

Because of the advantages of Prettier, we use it on top of the Airbnb config, and prefer Prettier's changes if there are any conflicts. Any ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier are turned off with [`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier).

Finally, some specific Airbnb rules are disabled, since they don't make much sense in certain contexts. You can see the specific exclusions in the [base.js](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/blob/main/packages/eslint-config-isaacscript/base.js) and [mod.js](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/blob/main/packages/eslint-config-isaacscript/mod.js) files of the [`eslint-config-isaacscript`](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/tree/main/packages/eslint-config-isaacscript) repository.

In order to avoid running two different tools, we could use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) to run Prettier as an ESLint rule. However, doing this [is not recommended by Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html). Thus, in order to use `isaacscript-lint`, you should be running both Prettier and ESLint on save. (More info on that is below.)

## Installation Instructions for TypeScript Projects

### Step 0 - Get a TypeScript Project Set Up

It should have a `package.json` file, a `tsconfig.json` file, and so on.

### Step 1 - Install the Dependency

```sh
npm install isaacscript-lint --save-dev
```

(It should be a development dependency because it is only used to lint your code pre-production.)

### Step 2 - `eslintrc.js`

Create a `eslintrc.js` file in the root of your repository:

```js
// This is the configuration file for ESLint, the TypeScript linter
// https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    // The linter base is the shared IsaacScript config
    // https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/blob/main/packages/eslint-config-isaacscript/base.js
    "eslint-config-isaacscript/base",
  ],

  parserOptions: {
    // ESLint needs to know about the project's TypeScript settings in order for TypeScript-specific
    // things to lint correctly
    // We do not point this at "./tsconfig.json" because certain files (such at this file) should be
    // linted but not included in the actual project output
    project: "./tsconfig.eslint.json",
  },

  // We modify the linting rules from the base for some specific things
  rules: {},
};
```

### Step 3 - `tsconfig.eslint.json`

Create a `tsconfig.eslint.json` file in the root of your repository:

<!-- cspell:ignore Gruntfile -->

```jsonc
// A special TypeScript configuration file, used by ESLint only.
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",

  // A list of the TypeScript files to compile:
  "include": [
    // This must match the "include" setting in the main "tsconfig.json" file.
    "./src/**/*.ts",

    // These are ESLint-only inclusions. Usually, this includes any files that are outside of your
    // "src" directory, such as "webpack.config.js", "jest.config.js", "Gruntfile.js", and so forth.
    "./.eslintrc.js"
  ]
}
```

<br>

## Adding or Removing Rules

You can add extra rules (or ignore existing rules) by editing the `rules` section of your `eslintrc.js` file. For example:

```js
  // We modify the linting rules from the base for some specific things
  rules: {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off",
  },
```

<br>

## Integration with VSCode

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or VSCode for short, is the most popular TypeScript editor / IDE.

<br>

### Extensions

In order for the linter inside of VSCode, you will have to install the following extensions:

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

### `.vscode/settings.json`

Furthermore, you will probably want Prettier and ESLint to be run automatically every time you save a TypeScript file. You can tell VSCode to do this by adding the following to your project's `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```jsonc
// These are Visual Studio Code settings that should apply to this particular repository
{
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": ["source.fixAll.eslint"],
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },

  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": ["source.fixAll.eslint"],
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

(Create this file if it does not already exist.)

You can also commit this file to your project's repository so that this behavior is automatically inherited by anyone who clones the project (and uses VSCode).

### `.vscode/extensions.json`

Optionally, you can also provide a hint to anyone cloning your repository that they should install the required extensions:

```jsonc
// These are Visual Studio Code extensions that are intended to be used with this particular
// repository
// https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846
{
  "recommendations": [
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode", // The TypeScript formatter
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", // The TypeScript linter
    "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker" // A spell-checker extension based on cspell
  ]
}
```
